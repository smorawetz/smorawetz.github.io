Local counterdiabatic driving (CD) provides a feasible approach for realizing approximate adiabatic or reversible processes like quantum state preparation using only local controls and without demanding excessively long protocol times. However, in many instances getting high accuracy of such CD protocols requires engineering very complicated new controls or pulse sequences. In this work, we describe a systematic method for altering the adiabatic path by adding extra local controls along which performance of local CD protocols is enhanced, both close to and far from the adiabatic limit. We also identify an iterative procedure to improve the performance of local counterdiabatic driving further without any knowledge of the quantum wave function. We then show that these methods provides dramatic improvement in the preparation of nontrivial Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger ground states of several different spin systems with both short-range and long-range interactions.
